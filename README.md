1. A Glaſs of Juſtification. Wherein the Apoſtles Doctrine touching JUSTIFICATION without the DEEDS of the LAW is opened; and the ſence in which Goſpel-Obedience is abſolutely neceſſary to Juſtification, is ſtated.

    _ CHAP. I. Containing an Introduction to the following Treatiſe.

    _ CHAP. II. Shewing of what ſort or kind of Works thoſe are which Paul in his Epiſtles excludes in the point of Mans juſtification before God.

    _ CHAP. III. Shewing how Love, Iuſtice, and Mercy, though commanded both in Law and Goſpel, are to he rejected in the Iewiſh ſenſe, and yet imbraced in the Chriſtians, as neceſſary unto Iustification. Shewing alſo in what ſence Works are neceſſary unto Iuſtification.

    _ CHAP. IV. Setting forth the object of juſtifying Faith, and ſhewing the beleeving in whom, and the beleeving of what it is, that will be counted for Righteouſneſſe.

    _ CHAP. V. Shewing that that Faith which conſiſts onely in aſſenting unto the truth of that report which the Goſpel makes touching Christ his being the Son of God, and of his coming into the World to ſave Sinners by dying for them, will not availe to Iuſtification and Salvation, as a Goſpel-Faith of the right kind will do.

    _ CHAP. VI. Further diſcovering that neither the act of Relyance or Dependence upon God or Christ for Salvation, without the concurrence of a loving and loyal adheſion to him, will avail to Salvation.

    _ CHAP. VII. Shewing that that Belief unto which the Promiſe is made, though indefinitely expreſt, is to be underſtood of Belief of a ſpecial kinde: and that it is no waies ſafe to notion it in the lowest, narrowest, and meaneſt ſence of the Word, but to frame our notion of it according to that reſult which the Scriptures compared do give of it: under which notion of it, it will be hard for any man to retain a confidence of Salvation, without an holy converſation.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Shewing that the Faith which ſhall juſtifie as Abrahams did, is a Faith that walks in the ſteps of the Faith of Abraham. Shewing alſo what thoſe ſteps were, and that Abraham was juſtified by the latter of them as well as the former; and that the juſtification of his ſpiritual ſeed ſtands upon the ſame terms: contrary to the Antinomian Doctrine, and Libertine Principles.

    _ CHAP. IX. Shewing that it hath been the common and univerſal Property of the Faith of Gods Elect, both in former and latter Ages of the World, as well to depend upon (and ſo to be ordered by) the counſels, commands, and directions of God touching the way to life, as upon his grace, power, and promiſe, for life it ſelf: and that it is the higheſt point of Wiſdom in men ſo to do. And that mens miſtruſt of the ſuparlative goodneſs of Gods wayes, counſels, and commands, and putting more confidence in their own, proceeds from their miſtruſt of his power, wiſdom, or good-will towards them, in relation to their happineſs.

    _ CHAP. X. Shewing, That the power of Gods grace, the ſtrength and fulneſs that is in Chriſt, the preſence, power, and influence of the Spirit, being that by which the new and ſpiritual Life in a Chriſtian is maintained, it is the Property of true Faith to depend upon the Lord for theſe. And herein is an excellent difference to be ſeen between the Living and the dead Faith. The want of this, the cauſe of manies Apoſtacie. A great defect in this, the cauſe of manies dryneſs and barrenneſs in grace.

    _ CHAP. XI. Shewing how Faith worketh by Love, both to God and Men.

    _ CHAP. XII. Shewing that Faith is counted for Righteouſneſſe, both as it entitles men to the juſtifying virtue of Chriſts Blood, and as it puts them under the protection and promiſe of the Goſpel, as it is a fulfilling of it. And ſo diſcovers the opinion of Mens being juſtified before Beleeving, and of being juſtified by beleeving only in the Court of Mans Conſcience, to be unſound.

    _ CHAP. XIII. Containing an Exhortation by way of vſe, for Men to behold themſelves in this Glaſs of Iuſtification, and by the help of the precedent Diſcourſe, to prove the goodneſs or badneſs of their title to life. And ſhewing the ill abode of negligence, and the real advantage, of care and diligence herein: and what must be done to obtain a good testimony from Conſcience as Iudge Delegate under Christ, touching the goodneſs of mens ſpiritual condition in the eye of the Goſpel, and in the ſight of God.
